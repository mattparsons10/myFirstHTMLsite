    <h1>Meribel! </h1>
    <p>Nestled in the beautiful Alpine valley of Les Allues, Méribel is a renowned ski resort where you can experience
        that quintessential ski holiday.
    </p>

    <p>Stay in a traditional wooden chalet, admire stunning mountain scenery, ski one of the biggest domains in the
        world and let your hair down at one
        of the famous après-ski bars. The Méribel Valley is one of the most popular destinations for British skiers (the
        resort was, in fact, founded by
        a British Colonel, Peter Lindsay, in 1938). Consisting of picture-postcard chalets and chalet-style apartment
        buildings and hotels, Méribel has
        retained all the charm of a traditional mountain village with its wood and stone buildings and forest
        setting.
    </p>
    <p>
        Fast, modern ski lifts offer easy
        access to the Méribel ski area (150km of pistes from 1450m up to 1700m) and the 3 Valleys (Méribel is linked to
        Courchevel and Val Thorens, giving
        you access to 600km of pistes). Méribel Centre is the largest of several villages in the resort and is home to
        the main shopping area and the greatest
        selection of restaurants.
